# Chess Robot
For STEM this term, we had to create a passion project. As we will be doing linefollowing robotic for RoboCup next year in term 1, I will be making a robotic arm play chess

In the back of the STEM room, we have 2 uArm Swift Pro desktop robotic arms. These arms move (relatively) fast, and have a camera on them.

This project uses many other projects whose code I have just yoinked.
- [Vatsalparsaniya/Realtime-OpenCV-Chess](https://github.com/Vatsalparsaniya/Realtime-OpenCV-Chess) for the board detection and recognition
- [andySigler/uArm-Python-Wrapper](https://github.com/andySigler/uArm-Python-Wrapper) for the Python wrapper and example that helped me program the robot
